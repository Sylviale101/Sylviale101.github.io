    <h1>Welcome to Sylvia's HTML practice page!</h1>
        <p>
            This is my first HTML practice page. Here, I will be learning html using some basic tags!
        </p>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>
            Although this may seem easy, always make sure you indent and organize your code well! Otherwise, everything will be cluttered...
        </p>

<!--This section is for practicing html tags.-->
    <h1>Basic Intro to HTML</h1>
    <h2>Creating Paragraphs</h2>
    <p>
        In order to create a body for a paragraph, you should use p and end the sentence with /p. By doing so, this is how you create your first paragraph!
    </p>
<!--How to use dividers-->
    <h2>Using Dividers</h2>
        <div>
            When using div and ending your code with /div it leaves your sentences and paragraphs with no spaces above or below, making your text squished.
            <br>
            It may seem indifferent to making paragraphs since they are similar to each other. However, if you pay close attention to how the text is cluttered, you'll notice it.
        </div>
<!--Using the Span Tag-->
    <h2>Using the Span Tag</h2>
        <p>
            By using the span tag, you can style your words and change the font of them. For example:
            I like the color <span style="color:plum">plum</span> a lot!
        </p>
<!--How to use Line Breaks-->
    <h2>Implementing Line Breaks</h2>
        <p>
            Let's say we're making a long paragraph and you want to make a sentence go onto the next line. By doing so, we use the tag br, which means to "break" a line.
            <br>
            This is an example of it!
        </p>
<!--How to Emphasize Text-->
    <h2>Emphasizing Text</h2>
        <p>
            Being able to emphasize text is nice. By being able to do so, I can use b to bold important text like <b>this</b> or use <strong>strong</strong> instead. I could  also
            create italic text by using an i tag like <i>this</i>
        </p>
<!--How to create a table-->
<h2>Creating A Table</h2>
        <p>
            Creating a table may seem intimidating but you can create a table by 
            using a td tag (The data cell of a table) or by using the tr tag (the rows in a table)
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>Here is an example of a table below.</b>
            </p>
        </p> 
        <!--Creating the body of a table-->
        <table border="1" width= "500">
            <tbody>
                <!--Creating rows for a table-->
                <tr>
                    <!--Setting the width of a data cell to 50% and inserting text-->
                    <td width="50%">Left side of the table</td>
                    <td width= "50%">Right side of the table</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <!--Colspan refers to the number of colomns in a table-->
                    <td colspan="2">
                        <p>
                            This is the top half of the table
                        </p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td colspan="2">
                        <p>
                        This is the bottom half of the table
                        </p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
            <h2>Creating A List</h2>
                <p>
                    A list in HTML can be created in three different ways: Ordered (ol), Unordered (ul), and descriptive (dl).
                </p>
            <!--Ordered Lists are numbered-->
            <h2>Ordered Lists</h2>
                <p>
                 <b>Here is an example of an ordered list below</b>
                </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Apple Juice</li>
                            <li>Grape Juice</li>
                            <li>Pear Juice</li>
                        </ol>
            <h3>Note</h3>
                        <p>
                            Ordered Lists appear <b>numbered</b>
                        </p>
            <!--Unordered lists have bullet points-->
            <h2>Unordered Lists</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Here is an example of a unordered list below</b>
                    <ul>
                            <li>Apple Juice</li>
                            <li>Grape Juice</li>
                            <li> Pear Juice</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Note</h3>
                    <p>
                        Unordered lists in HTML <b>appear bulleted</b>
                    </p>
            <!--Description lists provide detaied descriptions about an item within a list-->
            <h2>Description Lists</h2>
                <p>
                        <b>Here is an example of a description list below</b>
                        <dl>
                                <dt><b>Apple Juice</b></dt>
                                <dd><i>Juice Freshly pressed from apples</i></dd>
                                <dt><b>Grape Juice</b></dt>
                                <dd><i>Juice obtained from crushed grapes</i></dd>
                                <dt><b>Pear Juice</b></dt>
                                <dd><i>Fresh juice created from pears being blended with water</i></dd>
                        </dl>
                </p>
            <h3>Note</h3>
                <p>
                    Description lists have <b>three</b> different tags: dl <b>(description list)</b>, dt <b>(defined term)</b>, and dd <b>(the description of each term)</b>.
                </p>

            <h3>Notes</h3>
            <p>
                Indentation, consistantly saving and commenting while coding is an important habit to have. If I were to unindent/delete comments for my code for the table above then I could've been easily 
                gotten confused while writing my code, and I could've lost some of my code if something were to happen.
